# aml-text-classification
Using the Newsgroups dataset and the following machine learning methods 

-       SVM

-       Naive Bayes

-       Neural Network



You will need to use the techniques of stopping(removing small insignificant words eg I, the, you etc), stemming(removing the endings of words eg -ed -ing) and use of TF/IDF (Term Frequency over Item Document Frequency) to aid in the classification of the type of news report

This is a task which will require you to do some feature engineering to get decent accuracy

The submission will be the source code which will output a confusion matrix and overall accuracy of each classifier

 Dataset:

sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
